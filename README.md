## My process
- Gained alot of conficence with this one.

- Got one step close to my goals.

### What I learned

  ```
      -webkit-clip-path: polygon(13% 12%, 30% 38%, 47% 11%, 44% 20%, 31% 45%, 13% 17%, 0 43%);
    clip-path: polygon(13% 12%, 30% 38%, 47% 11%, 44% 20%, 31% 45%, 13% 17%, 0 43%);

  ```

### Continued development

I had trouble with the different shapes, some of them increase the screen width, thus added the horizontal scroll.
